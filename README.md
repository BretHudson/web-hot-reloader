# Web Hot Reloader

Automatically update your CSS in real-time, without having to add a single line of code to your project's codebase.

- ü™∂ Lightweight
- üåª Works with vanilla JS
- ‚öôÔ∏è Completely standalone application
- üö´ No reliance on build tools or post-processors
- üö´ No need to remove from production releases - it was never there in the first place!

## Motivation

Frameworks like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) have spoiled us with features like HMR (hot module reload), reducing developer friction when making small, incremental changes. Wouldn't it be nice to have a lightweight solution for vanilla JS projects, without having to use a framework?

And so, Web Hot Reloader was born. It consists of two parts: a Node.js process that lists to a directory for CSS file changes, and a script to inject websocket code into your web page.

## Setup

For this example, we're going to enable hot reloading for my website, which is, on my system, located at `C:\xampp\apps\brethudson`.

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Clone the repo

### Running the program

In my project, there is a `/css` folder containing all the CSS files. (See: [Current limitations](#current-limitations))

To initialize the hot reloader for this directory, we can type the following:

```cmd
node app C:\xampp\app\brethudson\css
```

Tip: You can override `PORT` (default `3008`) and `NODE_ENV` (default `production`) in your environment variables.

### Getting your browser to listen

Now, while you _could_ copy/paste [public/reloader.js](public/reloader.js) into your project and include it in every page that you want to use it on, that doesn't scale well, and also means that you would need to ensure it gets removed for the production/live site.

What I suggest is grabbing a browser extension such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), which will allow us to run scripts on certain pages!

[Click to Install UserScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BretHudson/web-hot-reloader/refs/heads/main/misc/reload-tampermonkey.user.js) ([Source Code](https://github.com/BretHudson/web-hot-reloader/blob/main/misc/reload-tampermonkey.user.js))

Within this file, every `@match` line will correspond to a URL path to match. For me, my project loads at `brethudson.localhost`. You can add as many of these as you want! In fact, I add a new line for each project. You could also match `https://localhost*` to capture all `localhost` activity to enable the hot reloading on all projects served on your computer.

## Current limitations

- Only CSS files are supported
- No recursive folder watching
- JS support is not currently on the roadmap

## Future plans

There really aren't any specific ones! Some things I would like to add:

- Recursive listening (`C:/project/css` would be able to listen to `C:/project/css/sub-folder` as well - meaning it would be possible to just use `C:/project` as the directory)
- <img> support
- JS support
- Project configuration files (`reloader.json` or `reloader.config.js`)
- Publish to `npm`
